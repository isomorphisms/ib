# Shizuku provider for the Android Binder host

## Current decision

Binder is IB's Android process/service architecture. Shizuku is the current
provider used to obtain that Binder authority on stock experimental Android.

The canonical boundary is documented in `docs/android-binder-host.md`.
Longview and browser semantics must depend on Binder capabilities rather than
on Shizuku, `rish`, or shell command syntax.

Crawl Space remains a possible later provider/variant. It is not an additional
mandatory hop in front of Shizuku.

```

## First implemented surface

`lib/android_shizuku_host.grease` currently provides:

- discovery of the `rish` executable, with `IB_RISH_COMMAND` as an explicit
  override;
- execution of one trusted Grease command through `rish -c`, preserving the
  remote exit status and stderr;
- effective-UID / authority inspection;
- an identity receipt including the remote `id` result and SELinux context
  when Android exposes it;
- a raw process snapshot through `ps -A`;
- validated PID/signal forwarding;
- package PID lookup through `pidof`;
- deliberate Android package stop through ActivityManager's `am force-stop`.

`bin/ib_android_shizuku.grease` exposes those operations for development.

Authority inspection preserves a failed UID query's exact nonzero status and
emits no authority on failure. A successful query must contain decimal digits
only: `0` means `root`, `2000` means `shell`, and other numeric values retain
the `uid:VALUE` classification. Empty or malformed output is rejected with
status 2 rather than being classified as authority. The Binder-facing caller
preserves the same result.

This is deliberately a small mechanism surface. Browser tasks, tab identity,
restart policy, durable results, and renderer policy remain owned by the Idriç
core.

The package-stop operation is immediately useful to the protected long-view
work: physical acceptance can kill the actual IB package through Shizuku rather
than requiring an ADB session, then verify that the durable task survives the
new host generation. The stop mechanism remains distinct from the durable task
semantics being tested.

## Current rish lowering

Upstream rish is specifically a shell whose process is created by the
high-privilege Shizuku/Sui daemon. It passes shell arguments to the remote
Android shell; for example, `rish -c 'ls'` executes `/system/bin/sh -c 'ls'`
remotely.

That makes it a useful first backend for IB process and operating-system work.
If command startup or text parsing later becomes measurable overhead, a direct
Shizuku Binder adapter can replace individual hot operations behind the same
Binder boundary.

Long-running work should eventually use maintained remote workers rather than a
large number of tiny `rish -c` calls. Those worker processes/threads remain
normal kernel-scheduled work; Shizuku supplies authority, not CPU scheduling.

## Evidence boundary

`tests/test_android_shizuku_host.grease` uses a fake rish executable only to
test local adapter behavior: argument forwarding, exit-status preservation,
identity classification, process/signal dispatch, and rejection of an unsafe
PID string.

The authority cases exercise both the Shizuku adapter and real Binder delegation
with root, shell, and ordinary UID controls; provider exits 37, 124, and a
permission denial; missing/nonexecutable providers; and malformed UID output.
`tests/test_android_binder_host.grease` also checks status forwarding at the
isolated provider boundary.

That test is **not** Shizuku acceptance. Physical MIRO A1 acceptance still must
show the exact branch revision running against real Shizuku/rish and record the
remote UID, SELinux context, process visibility, signal behavior, and exact
denials.
