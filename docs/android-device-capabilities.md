# Android device capability report

This report is the first storage/capacity implementation slice under #95. It
runs after the Binder/workaround audit in #106 and uses the existing Shizuku
host boundary from #93 rather than creating another Android authority layer.

The report is observational. It does not move data, create directories, reserve
space, fill a filesystem, remount storage, format media, or test executable
placement on an SD card.

## Interfaces

```text
bin/ib_android_capabilities.grease report
bin/ib_android_capabilities.grease summary
bin/ib_android_capabilities.grease app
```

`report` emits tab-separated machine-readable records. `summary` renders a
phone-readable subset from the same records.

The report schema is:

```text
KIND    NAME    STATUS    AUTHORITY    VALUE
```

The first line is `schema\tib-android-capabilities-v1`. Status and authority are
kept separate. A capability may be `measured`, `reported`, `unknown`,
`simulated`, `stale`, `invalid`, or `failed`; an unknown value is not zero and
is not success.

## Cat Food first, then live observation

IB consults Cat Food persistent state before asking Android about the live
machine. Today the concrete shared contract is Cat Food's preserved Shizuku
`rish` bundle from `isomorphisms/catfood#93` / PR #94. When present, IB reports
the snapshot id, source path, manager package and hashes from Cat Food's receipt.

Cat Food now supplies an existing per-installation `device-id` and versioned
`device/inventory.tsv`. IB reads those without creating state and checks that
the inventory identity agrees with the local identity before reporting its
reference and observation time. Missing and mismatched inventory remains unknown
or stale; a model name cannot join installations. `IB_DEVICE_LABEL` remains an
explicit acceptance label, separate from that identity.

Saved and active rish hashes are independently checked rather than treating
receipt text as verification. See [rish-bundle-provenance.md](rish-bundle-provenance.md)
for the separate receipt, saved-pair, selected-launcher, DEX-mode and live-authority
fields and their concurrency/physical limitations.

Cat Food is configuration/history. It cannot prove that a remembered SD card is
currently mounted or that the IB app UID can write it. Live storage state is
observed separately.

## One bounded Shizuku snapshot

The shell report first records the current IB checkout head when Git can resolve it. The APK report independently records its embedded `IB_SOURCE_HEAD`, package version, build fingerprint and Android build identity, so physical receipts can be matched to the exact artifact rather than only to a phone model.

The Android observations are collected in one trusted static `rish -c` command,
not one shell process per field. It records:

- shell UID, `id` identity and SELinux context;
- product model, build fingerprint, Android release/API and ABI lists;
- bounded `df` rows;
- bounded `sm list-volumes all` rows;
- selected mount rows for `/data`, `/storage` and `/mnt/media_rw`;
- `MemTotal`, `MemAvailable`, swap/zram-related `/proc/meminfo` rows and
  memory-pressure information when readable;
- whether a mounted Android public volume is observed;
- whether appendfat is observed in current mounts.

A mounted public Android volume is surfaced as a **bulk candidate**, with its
mount path and `df` total/available KiB when a matching row exists. This is a
candidate, not a placement decision.

Counters remain text/wide integer values. The deterministic fixture includes a
32-bit phone profile and a public volume above 4 GiB so an implementation that
narrows sizes to 32 bits is rejected.

## What the report refuses to infer

Several Android pathnames can expose the same backing storage. A `df` row and an
Android volume record are observations, not proof of independent physical
capacity pools. The first report therefore does not add them together. It emits
`capacity_pool_relationship=unknown` until backing relationships are established
by evidence.

Likewise, shell visibility is not application write authority. The shell report
therefore emits `ib_app_writer_access=unknown`.

The APK has a separate read-only app-UID observation at
`DeviceCapabilitiesActivity`. It enumerates `getFilesDir()` and
`getExternalFilesDirs(null)`, records Android's external-storage state,
removable/emulated flags, the app-visible volume UUID when available,
`File.canWrite()`, and long-valued `StatFs` total/available byte counts. A
mounted removable app-specific external root may be reported as the app-side
bulk candidate.

Launch that view through the same Shizuku adapter without starting the heavy
Longview WebView:

```sh
sh bin/ib_android_capabilities.grease app
```

The underlying Android operation is the fixed component launch
`am start -W -n org.isomorphisms.ib.webview/.DeviceCapabilitiesActivity`; no
page/user/model string is interpolated into the privileged command.

The report is visible and copyable on the phone. It performs no test write.
`canWrite()` plus a framework-approved app root is therefore **reported writer
evidence**, not the measured small-write acceptance required by #96.

A large removable volume must never cause Longview to silently fall back to
internal storage or assume that some other public path is writable.

Disk and RAM remain separate. A large SD card does not authorize a large decoded
image, JavaScript heap, or other RAM working set.

## Appendfat and future capabilities

`IB_SIMULATE_APPENDFAT=1` adds a separate
`appendfat_simulation=simulated` record. It does not change the physical
`appendfat_status` record. A mock can therefore exercise future reserve/append
policy without claiming that appendfat is installed on the phone.

The same rule applies to later capabilities: simulated, reported, measured,
denied and unknown states must remain distinguishable.

## Deterministic acceptance

`tests/test_android_device_capabilities.grease` covers two installations with
the same `MIRO A1` model:

- one with a large mounted public volume;
- one without a public volume.

It also checks Cat Food snapshot ingestion, a >4 GiB capacity, explicit
appendfat simulation, unknown app-writer authority, and a lexical read-only
tripwire over the trusted remote command.

These tests prove the shell/Cat Food observation contract and source-level
read-only app adapter boundary. Physical acceptance still must run the exact
source head against real Shizuku/rish on each phone, copy the app-UID report,
and preserve both reports as evidence.

#96 must perform the first deliberately bounded write before Longview treats a
reported root as measured writable storage.
